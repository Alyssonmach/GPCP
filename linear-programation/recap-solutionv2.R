# Problem description:
# A motor company has three factories located in Rio de Janeiro, SÃ£o Paulo, and Belo Horizonte.
# The company must deliver its production to three consumer centers: Recife, Salvador, and Manaus.
# Each factory has a limited production capacity, and each consumer center has a fixed demand.
# Transportation costs per motor unit between factories and consumer centers are given in the table.
# 
# Objective:
# Determine how many motor units each factory should send to each consumer center
# in order to satisfy all demands without exceeding capacities,
# while minimizing the total transportation cost.

# Objective function coefficients (to minimize)
# Cost = 25*X1 + 20*X2 + 30*X3 + 30*Y1 + 25*Y2 + 25*Y3 + 20*Z1 + 15*Z2 + 23*Z3

# Each row corresponds to a constraint:

# 2. Y1 + Y2 + Y3 <= 3000
# 3. Z1 + Z2 + Z3 <= 1500
# 4. X1 + Y1 + Z1  = 2000
# 5. X2 + Y2 + Z2  = 2000
# 6. X3 + Y3 + Z3  = 1000
